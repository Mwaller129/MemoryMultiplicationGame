### **_Description_**
The Multiplication Memory Game is designed to help 2nd and 3rd grade students memorize mulitplication tables in a fun way. 

The game will start by presenting the user with a multiplication problem from the 5's times table. 

The user will select the correct answer from the board below the multiplication problem containing 12 possible answers.

If the correct answer is selected, that tile will disappear from the board and a new multiplication problem from the 5 times table will display. 

There is a total of 12 multiplcation problems to solve. If the user selects the wrong answer, that tile will remain visible. A new multiplication problem will display and the user will have a chance to attempt all multiplication problems they missed before the game ends.

After answering all problems correctly, a congratulatory message will display and the user has a chance to play again.
